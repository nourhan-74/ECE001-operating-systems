    <h1>what is operating system ?</h1>
<pre><h3>An Operating system (OS) is a software which acts as an interface between the 
end user and computer hardware. Every computer must have at least one OS to run 
other programs. An application like Chrome, MS Word, Games, etc needs some 
environment in which it will run and perform its task. The OS helps you to 
communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's 
language. It is not possible for the user to use any computer or mobile device 
without having an operating system.</h3></pre>
