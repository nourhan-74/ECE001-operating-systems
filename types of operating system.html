<h2> Batch Operating System</h2>
<h3>Some computer processes are very lengthy and time-consuming. To speed the same

<h2>Real time OS</h2>
<h3>A real time operating system time interval to process and respond to inputs is very small. Examples: Military Software 
Systems, Space Software Systems.</h3>

<h2>Distributed Operating System</h2>
<h3>Distributed systems use many processors located in different machines to provide very fast computation to its users.</h3>
